The scripts in this folder are required to generate PanGIA uniqueness scores after a PanGIA database has been built.

If a database has been built, you should have *gottcha_db.{strain/species/genus/etc.}.list files. 
These are needed as input to uniqueness.sh, your master script that calls the others.

uniqueness.sh is formatted as though it will use a job scheduler. This does not need to remain true, as nothing objectively requires a scheduler.
This is equally true for uge_gottcha_db.sh - *though it is worth noting here that there are hard coded variables for RAM and thread count in this script.*

Uniqueness calculations are lengthy, but parallelizable (and parallelized).
The original PanGIA DB (with additions for various South American viruses and assorted plasmodia) took about 3 days to complete for ~17GB of input fasta and I think I did it with 32 threads.
Good luck.

gottcha should not be required.
openmpi and gcc are required.
GNU parallel is required
python is required
PanGIA's taxonomy.py is required.
btl self,sm,tcp are all required. These are, or were, part of openmpi at some point.
If any of these are missing, google is your friend. GNU parallel can be conda installed. openmpi and its assorted packages may be more complicated.
You can probably escape the need for openmpi by rewriting parts of uge_gottcha_db.sh

#Possible error related to btl# 
As of version 3.0.0, the "sm" BTL is no longer available in Open MPI.
Efficient, high-speed same-node shared memory communication support in
Open MPI is available in the "vader" BTL.  To use the vader BTL, you
can re-run your job with:
    mpirun --mca btl vader,self,... your_mpi_application

A requested component was not found, or was unable to be opened.  This
means that this component is either not installed or is unable to be
used on your system (e.g., sometimes this means that shared libraries
that the component requires are unable to be found/loaded).  Note that
Open MPI stopped checking at the first component that it did not find.
